<p *ngIf='!loggedIn'>
    I am the login component. I should only be visible if you aren't logged <br>
    Logging on successfully should hide this dialog. <br>
    Someday I'll have forms and buttons that work!
</p>

  <form>
    Email:    <input id="email" type="email" name="email" size="35"><br>
    Password: <input id="password" type="password" name="password" size="35"><br>
    <button (click)="login()" alt="Submit" width="48" height="48">Submit</button>
  </form>
